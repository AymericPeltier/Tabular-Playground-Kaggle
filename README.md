# Tabular-Playground-Kaggle

Kaggle Tabular Playground competitions are the perfect place to share with other Data Practitionner & improve different skills.
It also allows me to experiment on various type of data & dataset size.

## TPS_July: Time Series EDA

[Link to Kaggle's competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-jul-2021/data)

### Task:

In this competition you are predicting the values of air pollution measurements over time, based on basic weather information (temperature and humidity) and the input values of 5 sensors.

The three target values to you to predict are: target_carbon_monoxide, target_benzene, and target_nitrogen_oxides

### My work

During this TPS, I focused on EDA & some features engineering methods that are valuable when working on time series.

## TPS_August: Ensembling & Optuna

[Link to Kaggle's competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-aug-2021/data)

### Task:

For this competition, you will be predicting a target loss based on a number of feature columns given in the data. The ground truth loss is integer valued, although predictions can be continuous.

The dataset is used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with calculating the loss associated with a loan defaults. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features.

### My work

During this TPS, I got used to hyperparameters tuning with Optuna & ensembling some models (XGboost, Catboost, LightGBM, Neural Network)

## TPS_Septebmer: Stacking & Optuna

[Link to Kaggle's competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-sep-2021/data)

### Task:

For this competition, you will predict whether a customer made a claim upon an insurance policy. The ground truth claim is binary valued, but a prediction may be any number from 0.0 to 1.0, representing the probability of a claim. The features in this dataset have been anonymized and may contain missing values.

TThe dataset is used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with predicting whether a claim will be made on an insurance policy. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features.

### My work

During this TPS, I focused on Stacking different models & reused optuna with some additional properties to optimize how fast I could tune the models.
